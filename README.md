# Fine-tuning exploration

Claude prompt:

```text
Could you design me a short and simple beginner finetuning project?

By the end of it I need to

- Know about the key chapters of a typical fine-tuning process
- Have a fine-tuned model of my very own from the execution of some script that I build step by step with the help of piecewise code snippets generated by your prompt
- Have basic tools with which to reason about benchmarks and model performance, preferably with some way to definitively compare the different performances of a model as a result of the fine tuning process
```

This is a short and simple beginner fine-tuning project. We'll fine-tune a small language model on a sentiment analysis task using movie reviews. This project will cover the key steps of a typical fine-tuning process and include a bonus section on benchmarking.

Let's begin with an overview of the project structure:

1. Setup and Data Preparation
2. Model Selection and Loading
3. Data Processing
4. Fine-tuning
5. Evaluation
6. Bonus: Benchmarking

Let's break down the key chapters and explain each part of the script:

1. Setup and Data Preparation:

   - We import necessary libraries and load a subset of the IMDB dataset.
   - We create a custom Dataset class to handle our movie reviews.

2. Model Selection and Loading:

   - We choose DistilBERT as our base model and load it using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

3. Data Processing:

   - We create instances of our custom Dataset and DataLoader for efficient batching.

4. Fine-tuning:

   - We set up the optimizer and run the training loop for a specified number of epochs.

5. Evaluation:

   - We define an evaluation function to calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

6. Bonus: Benchmarking:
   - We create a benchmarking function to compare the original and fine-tuned models.
   - We load the original pre-trained model and compare its performance with our fine-tuned model.

After running the script, you'll see the performance metrics for both the original and fine-tuned models, as well as the improvements achieved through fine-tuning.

This project demonstrates the key steps in a fine-tuning process:

1. Preparing your data
2. Selecting and loading a pre-trained model
3. Processing the data for the model
4. Fine-tuning the model on your dataset
5. Evaluating the model's performance
6. Comparing the fine-tuned model to the original

The bonus benchmarking section provides a clear way to see the impact of fine-tuning on the model's performance.
